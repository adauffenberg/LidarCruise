# LidarCruise

LidarCruise is a level 1 autonomous active cruise control system for my 2005 Mazda6. By interfacing with my steering wheel cruise control buttons and a Lidar unit, the distance to the object ahead can be varied.

This repo includes the code for the 4 Arduinos and a simple wiring diagram.
