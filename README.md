# LidarCruise

Lidar Cruise is a level 1 autonomous active cruise control system for my 2005 Mazda6. By interfacing with my steering wheel cruise control buttons and a Lidar unit, the distance to the object ahead can be varied.

Included in this Repo:

## 2 Matlab files: 
These were used during conceptualization of the project. Although not used on the final hardware for various reasons, they provided valuable knowledge at the start.

## 4 Arduino Ino files:
These run on the 4 arduinos that make up Lidar Cruise

### Ino to Website guide

LidarACC is Arduino 3

VSS_ACC is Arduino 2

MirrorACC is Arduino 1

ControlACC is Arduino 4

## 1 Fritzing file: 
This file allowed planning of wiring for Lidar Cruise

## 1 Blender file: 
This object was 3D printed, allowing waterproof connection of the Lidar tube and window.
